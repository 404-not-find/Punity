# Punity

A tiny game framework inspired by HandmadeHero.org, Love2D and PICO-8 for making low resolution retro games. Framework is built around an idea to give the developer tools to build his own tools. It provides a foundation for making games and tools only using C.

The primary motivation was to get ready for porting [@x_rxi](https://twitter.com/x_rxi)'s engine to [SDL2](http://libsdl.org) to support [GCW Zero](http://gcw-zero.com) and mobile. But it all went a bit different way, as you can see.


**Currently the engine is being reworked to something a bit more advanced, as I myself need a bit more control. To get something that works, take a look at my LudumDare game called [33 grams](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=55211), especially to it's [source](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5799921/LD34/33grams-v5-source.zip) which contains everything in one package and should work out of the box.**
